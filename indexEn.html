                    I am a second-year student pursuing a University Bachelor of Technology (BUT) in Computer Science,
                     specializing in Application Development: Design, Development, and Validation.
                    I am currently seeking an internship. I have experience using Python to create simple applications or games, and I am also proficient in C#,
                    which I use to develop more complex applications and both 2D and 3D games.

                <p>We have a project to create a copy of the Uber website using agile development. For this, we are using Laravel for the web development part.
                    We also need to design the database while ensuring compliance with GDPR regulations. To achieve this, we are using SQL to create our tables,
                     constraints, and indexes.<br>
                     The goal: to replicate the services of Uber, UberEats, and UberVelo. Understand how the Agile methodology works.<br>

                In a team of three, we created a monster elimination game. This game was developed using the UNITY game engine. The map was created by us using Unity assets, while the weapons and monsters were designed in Blender. The sounds were also created by us.<br>
                The goal: to kill as many monsters as possible.<br>
                The concept of the game: Kill monsters to earn experience points.<br>
                The methods:
            </p>
            <ul class="vertical-ul">
               <li>1 laser pistol: short-range, fast shooting. Deals low damage.

               <li>1 sniper rifle: long-range, slow shooting. Deals high damage.</li>

                    In the first year of my University Bachelor of Technology (BUT) in Computer Science, as part of a SAE (Educational Assessment Project), in a group of two, we created this game in two weeks.
We used WPF and the C# programming language.<br>
The goal: to eliminate all the obstacles in front of you.<br>

The concept of the game: Avoid all asteroids or enemies charging towards you by any means at your disposal. But be careful, asteroids are indestructible with your projectiles.<br>
The methods: Several consumable power-ups. To obtain these power-ups, you will need to go through the shop.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A shield that makes you invincible and grants points.</li>
                    <li>A health kit that restores your life to 100%.</li>
                    <li>A nuclear bomb that reduces everything to ashes.</li>

                        Dragon Slayer is a single-player game. It is currently being developed with Python and the customtkinter graphic library.<br>
                        The goal: Reach the highest level.<br>
                        The concept of the game: Wander through a randomly generated terrain and eliminate the dragons encountered using your team. The team can contain up to 6 dragons.<br>
